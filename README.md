# Multioutput classification

When I started learning different machine learning algorithms, I always asked myself how to handle multiple targets. That is, for a regression we need to predict multiple target variables and same for classification. This project explains how to use the Sklearn multioutput class for handling multiple outputs for classification and regression.
